          "The Couch Gag is an anthology of stories centered around an incomprehensible principle. We get to that in the first episode. Whereas you do not typically need to read an anthology in any prescribed order (lest it run the risk of not being a fucking anthology), but read the origin first. What we have following the origin, are several tales that follow persons of interest on their journeys to find fulfillment and meaning in a post-meaning existence. As writers, as human beings that believe in a distorted body-dysmorphic principle of truth, we try not to pull any punches. That being said, not every story will be for everyone. What's provided here are our tastes of the world as we see it. I, Editor in Christ of this Organization, have taken the artistic liberty to provide vignettes of the stories that accompany the first season. They are provided below to give you a loose composium of what to expect from us going forward. Which is more than you get from your partner or place of employment, mind you.",
